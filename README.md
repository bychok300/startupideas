### **ForlmulaTranslator** - basic idea is transform formulas from pictures to python code.

**How to do**: 

I think that simple way to do it is use openCV.
First of all you need to learn to recognize formulas at pictures. You may use short list of it to less the training time. Second step is build an algorithm, that will transform recognized formulas from pictures and it will transform it to python code. [&#128285;](#Up)

### **BitDream** - doing not usual things for money.

**Idea :** Suppose you are wierd boy/girl that can jump into cactus forest or let your friend punch you in balls. You often take a video of this craziest things post it on youtube, try to be popular. But will you do some tasks for somebody, who can pay to you, for your discusting doings?

**main features :** i think that applications like this must have some anonymous technologies, bitcoin as a pay service and strong verification of content. 

**basic concept :** you create account and can create new tasks that will on main page of app. Another users can do it task, and share to you the evidence that task was done, but the verifications of how truthly was evidence will do by admins of app. After verifying of evidance user can get a money for his finished task. After it you can publish it on main page or in the relevant section, or make it private and just take your money. [&#128285;](#Up)

### **SmartHomeTemp** - temperature control by neural network.

**idea** - if you got a smart home tool kit you may collect data about temperature in house and temperature out  of house. After it you may train neural net and she will control temperature.

**main feature :** So, i think that main feature it is a automated collecting data and neural network training. I think that if temperature on street higher hour after hour the conditioner need more energy to ensure a stable temperature inside of house. Thats why we need machine learning, i think that it can help control temperature and energy balance to ensure comfortable temperature in and  less using energy. [&#128285;](#Up)

### **HotOrNot** - how much you hot

**idea** - we need a dataset  with photo and average assessment of beauty of girl/boy. [&#128285;](#Up)

<a name="trafficJamController"></a>

### **TrafficJamController** - predict traffic jam.

**basic concept :** We've got Yandex maps API for business (for example). We will load all info about traffic jams per some time, second step it train neural net and try to predict traffic jams.  [&#128285;](#Up)


----------------------------------------------


<a name="DroneForConstructions"></a>

### **DroneForConstructions** - drone for manufacturing.

**basic concept :** if you need up large object you need to use helicopter or huge crane, but what if you build huge drone that can bring to the top huge object. [🔝](#Up) .  [&#128285;](#Up)
