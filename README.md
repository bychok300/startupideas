 1. **ForlmulaTranslator** - basic idea is transform formulas from pictures to python code.

**How to do**: 
I think that simple way to do it is use openCV.
First of all you need to learn to recognize formulas at pictures. You may use short list of it to less the training time. Second step is build an algorithm, that will transform recognized formulas from pictures and it will transform it to python code.
