**Startup**
===============================================
This is a list of ideas for Sturtups
-----------------------------------------------
**ForlmulaTranslator** - basic idea is transform formulas from pictures to python code.

**How to do**: 

I think that simple way to do it is use openCV.
First of all you need to learn to recognize formulas at pictures. You may use short list of it to less the training time. Second step is build an algorithm, that will transform recognized formulas from pictures and it will transform it to python code.
-----------------------------------------------

**BitDream** - doing not usual things for money.

**Idea :** Suppose you are wierd boy/girl that can jump into cactus forest or let your friend punch you in balls. You often take a video of this craziest things post it on youtube, try to be popular. But will you do some tasks for somebody, who can pay to you, for your discusting doings?

**main features :** i think that applications like this must have some anonymous technologies, bitcoin as a pay service and strong verification of content. 

**basic concept :** you create account and can create new tasks that will on main page of app. Another users can do it task, and share to you the evidence that task was done, but the verifications of how truthly was evidence will do by admins of app. After verifying of evidance user can get a money for his finished task. After it you can publish it on main page or in the relevant section, or make it private and just take your money.
